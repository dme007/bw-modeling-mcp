/**
 * Build a BW client from a BTP destination.
 *
 * Two destination styles are supported, chosen by the destination itself:
 *
 *   Authentication=PrincipalPropagation — per-user. The caller's JWT is exchanged at
 *     the Destination service for a value the Cloud Connector turns into a short-lived
 *     X.509 certificate, so BW sees the actual person and applies their own
 *     authorizations.
 *
 *   Authentication=BasicAuthentication — shared. The destination carries one technical
 *     user; every caller reaches BW as that user. Simpler to set up, but BW cannot tell
 *     callers apart, so the MCP scopes are the only per-user control.
 *
 * Both may run through the Cloud Connector (ProxyType=OnPremise) or connect directly.
