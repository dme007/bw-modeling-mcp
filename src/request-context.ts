/**
 * Request-scoped BW client, used by the HTTP transport.
 *
 * Under principal propagation the client carries one user's identity, so it cannot be
 * a module-level singleton. Rather than thread a parameter through every tool and
 * helper, the active client lives in an AsyncLocalStorage for the duration of the
 * request. `createClientFromEnv()` consults it (see bw-client.ts), which is what lets
 * the ~30 existing in-tool "fresh session" call sites keep working unchanged while
 * still running as the calling user.
 *
 * stdio does not use this: there is one process, one user, one set of credentials.
